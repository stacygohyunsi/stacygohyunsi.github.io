Hello, glad you made it here. I am Stacy, nice to meet you. Check me and more shitty projects out <a href="https://imstacy.com">here</a>.

I am a software engineer in Singapore and during my free time I do lame projects (like this one), hoping to think that one day I could be walking along the streets and people would randomly point at me and say " Oh, I remember you made _____". Ok maybe that's enough about me...


If you have any suggestions for improvements or if you just want to tell me how much my project sucks, my email is <a href="hello@imstacy.com">hello@imstacy.com</a>.
